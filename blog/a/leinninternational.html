01 Learning Compass:

What is a Learning Compass?

Learning compass is a committed personal learning plan. By creating and using it the learner reflects and explores his/her learning path from different perspectives (past, current moment and future). These explorations are crafted into an action plan; it includes long-term strategic goals and short-term tactical ones, means to get to these goals and measurements of success.

While in LEINN International, the learning compass is not merely a plan (or a wish-list), but as the name implies, a contract, with him/herself and with other learners. The learning contract is a “living document”, it is regularly updated and checked by the learner, his/her peer learners and the team coach.

Choose the format that suits you best: paper, slideshow, website…

Learning Compass’ Framework :

Learning history 02 Where am I now?
